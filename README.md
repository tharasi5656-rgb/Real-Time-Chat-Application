The project titled “Real-Time Chat Application” is developed as part of the final phase submission for the Information Technology Department of Anjalai Ammal Mahalingam Engineering College. The main objective of this project is to design and implement a real-time communication platform that enables users to exchange text and media messages instantly through a secure and interactive web interface. The application is built using Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO, and React.js, ensuring seamless, low-latency data transmission and an engaging user experience. The system incorporates JWT-based authentication for secure login and registration, allowing users to maintain their accounts safely. The chat interface displays all user contacts and conversation histories dynamically, while real-time messaging ensures instant delivery without reloading the page.
Additional features include read receipts, typing indicators, online/offline status, and in-app notifications, which enhance user interaction. 
Moreover, the application supports file and image sharing using cloud storage solutions such as MinIO or AWS S3, and also provides group chat functionality for multi-user conversations. 
Overall, this project demonstrates the development of a modern, efficient, and responsive web-based chat system similar to popular messaging platforms like WhatsApp or Messenger, showcasing strong integration of web technologies and real-time communication protocols.
The Real-Time Chat Application is a full-stack, web-based communication platform designed to enable users to exchange text messages instantly and securely in real time. Built using modern technologies such as Node.js,
Express.js, Socket.IO, and React, it provides a seamless, low-latency chatting experience with a clean and responsive user interface. The application allows users to sign up and log in securely using JWT-based authentication, ensuring data privacy and secure access. Once logged in, users can view their conversations, check online/offline statuses, and engage in one-to-one or group chats. Messages are transmitted instantly through Socket.IO, without requiring page reloads, maintaining a smooth flow of communication.

In addition to text messaging, the app supports rich media interactions—users can send and receive images,
files, and emojis, with media uploads handled efficiently through cloud storage services such as MinIO or AWS S3.
Features like typing indicators, read receipts, and in-app notifications enhance user engagement and make communication more interactive.
The backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, manages real-time socket connections.The project also focuses on scalability and reliability, with deployment on platforms like Render, Vercel, or Netlify, integrated with GitHub
for version control.
Overall, this Real-Time Chat Application successfully replicates WhatsApp- or Slack-like functionality, demonstrating secure real-time communication, efficient data handling, and a smooth, user-friendly interface.
